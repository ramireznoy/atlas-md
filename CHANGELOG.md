### Added
- Sticky page header — stays visible while scrolling
- Per-document scroll position memory (restored when switching back to a file)
- Auto-open browser on server launch with Enter-to-confirm prompt
- Server disconnect overlay — informs user when the server stops
- Persistent session token stored in `~/.mdatlas/token` (survives server restarts)
- Custom SVG logo in the sidebar
- Keyboard shortcuts: `Ctrl/Cmd+S` save, `Ctrl/Cmd+I` toggle edit/read, `F1` shortcuts modal
- Shortcuts modal using Tabler modal component
- Syntax highlighting for fenced code blocks via highlight.js (auto-detects language when unspecified)

### Changed
- All rendered markdown links open in a new tab
- Action buttons reorganised as a proper Tabler button group
- Sidebar and page headers aligned to a consistent height using a shared CSS variable
- Sidebar header uses custom SVG logo replacing the default icon
- Markdown theme extracted into a swappable CSS file (`/css/markdown/`)
- highlight.js loaded from cdnjs to ensure the UMD browser bundle is served

- CodeMirror blank editor on first open — added missing `overlay.min.js` addon
